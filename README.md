# DATA ANALYTICS POTFOLIO
I am a data analyst and aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in data analytics, programming, and AI-powered tools. My expertise spans across collecting, organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data to drive smart, data-informed business decisions.

I am highly proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and I have hands-on experience in FastAPI, AI tools, data science techniques, and web scraping. I have a solid grasp of core data concepts such as data mining, merging, statistical analysis, dashboard creation, report writing, and critical thinking.

This portfolio showcases a variety of projects that reflect my skill set. Additionally, I’ve included coding projects built  that demonstrate my ability to work with large, complex data sets, perform exploratory analysis, and integrate data from multiple sources. 

I am confident that my blend of technical skills, analytical thinking, and hands-on project experience positions me well for any data analyst or junior data scientist role. I invite you to explore my portfolio, and I would welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team.
